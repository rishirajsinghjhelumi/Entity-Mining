        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">1. Introduction</h3>
        This is a template for IRE 2014 Major Project Report. If you are viewing it in a browser, please look at the source code for details.
        <br><br>
        You can use H3 tags to mark section headers. Remember to use the class <b>ire2014_h3</b>. Each section should be numbered. You may explain
        the project requirements and scope in this section. Define the problem properly. You may also choose to provide a roadmap of this paper, ie,
        explain the content of various sections in brief.
        
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">2. Related Work</h3>
        Sections are not rigid. In related work, you can mention the previous works you followed for reference or which are related to
        your project. You should include references to the tools and techniques you used as a part of the project. 
        
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">3. Approach</h3>
        Explain your proposed approach here. Filler Text : We now describe the details of building such a system and summarize other systems built for this task. We define entity linking as matching a textual entity
        mention, possibly identified by a named entity recognizer, to a KB entry, such as a Wikipedia page that is a canonical entry for that entity. An entity linking query
        is a request to link a textual entity mention in a given document to an entry in
        a KB. The system can either return a matching entry or NIL to indicate there is
        no matching entry. In this work we focus on linking organizations, geo-political
        entities and persons to a Wikipedia derived KB. While the problem is applicable
        for any language, in this paper we restriction our attention to matching English
        names to an English knowledge base.
        
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">3.1. Assumptions</h4>
        This is a subsection. You can use <b>h4</b> tag for it along with <b>ire2014_h4</b> class. Again, the sections and subsections in this template are not rigid.
        Feel Free to modify as per requirement. Lists can be included if required :
        <ul class="ire2014_list">
            <li>You can Add UL or OL</li>
            <li>Class to be used is <b>ire2014_list</b></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">3.2. Architecture</h4>
        <figure class="ire2014_imgright">
            <img src="sampleImg.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
            <figcaption>Caption 2 : Remember to provide captions for each figure </figcaption>
        </figure>
        You can add diagrams using img tag. By default all the images would be centered. 
                    
        If you wish to put image to the right, you can choose the class <b>ire2014_imgright</b> instead. You can adjust the image size using
        img tag attributes
        
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">3.3. Theory</h4>
        Add as many sections and subsections as you wish. Random Text.
        What remains is to determine how high a score indicates that two records truly
        represent the same individual. In the example at hand, there was an easy
        way to make that decision, and the technique can be applied in many similar
        situations. It was decided to look at the creation-dates for the records at hand,
        and to assume that 90 days was an absolute maximum delay between the time
        the service was bought at Company A and registered at B. Thus, a proposed
        match between two records that were chosen at random, subject only to the
        constraint that the date on the B-record was between 0 and 90 days after the
        date on the A-record, would have an average delay of 45 days.<br><br>
        It was found that of the pairs with a perfect 300 score, the average delay was
        10 days. If you assume that 300-score pairs are surely correct matches, then you
        can look at the pool of pairs with any given score s, and compute the average
        delay of those pairs. Suppose that the average delay is x, and the fraction of
        true matches among those pairs with score s is f. Then x = 10f + 45(1 ? f),
        or x = 45?35f. Solving for f, we find that the fraction of the pairs with score
        s that are truly matches is (45 ? x)/35.
        
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">4. Evaluation and Results</h3>
        You may add/remove sections according to your content. There's no restriction to that.

        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">5. Conclusion</h3>
        Our initial experiments suggest that sparse Bayesian logistic regression coupled with
        high-dimensional document representations shows considerable promise as a tool for
        authorship attribution. However, significant challenges concerning representation
        remain; different document representations can lead to different attributions and
        no clear method exists for accounting for this uncertainty
